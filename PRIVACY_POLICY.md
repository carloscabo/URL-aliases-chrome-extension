# Privacy Policy for URL Aliases Chrome Extension

*Last updated: March 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the URL Aliases Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles your data. The Extension is designed to be privacy-focused and transparent about data usage.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What data we collect and store:

1. **Aliases and URLs**: The Extension stores the aliases and corresponding URLs that you create. This data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's `storage.sync` API, which means:
   - The data is stored within your browser
   - If you're signed into Chrome, this data may be synchronized across your devices
   - The data is not accessible to the developer or any third parties

2. **No Personal Information**: The Extension does not collect or store any personal information including but not limited to:
   - Names
   - Email addresses
   - IP addresses
   - Browsing history (beyond the URLs you explicitly save as aliases)
   - Demographics
   - Device information

### Data usage:

The stored aliases and URLs are used exclusively to:
- Display your aliases in the Extension popup
- Redirect you to the corresponding URL when you use an alias

## Data Sharing

The Extension **does not**:
- Share your data with any third parties
- Send your data to any external servers
- Use any analytics or tracking services
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies

## Data Security

The Extension uses Chrome's built-in storage APIs which provide standard browser security protections. Since all data is stored locally and not transmitted externally, the risk of data breach is minimized.

## User Controls

You have full control over your data:
- You can view all stored aliases in the Extension popup
- You can add, edit, or delete any alias at any time
- You can export your data as a JSON file for backup
- You can import previously exported data
- You can completely remove all stored data by either:
  - Deleting all aliases through the Extension interface
  - Uninstalling the Extension

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. We will notify users of any significant changes through the Extension or the Chrome Web Store listing.
